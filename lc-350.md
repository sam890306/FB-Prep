#找到两个数组之间的连续相似值
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example 1:

`Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]`

Example 2:

`Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]`

Note:

Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.
Follow up:

What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

## Algorithm

If nums1 is larger than nums2, swap the arrays.

For each element in nums1:

Add it to the hash map m.

Increment the count if the element is already there.
Initialize the insertion pointer (k) with zero.

Iterate along nums2:

If the current number is in the hash map and count is positive:

Copy the number into nums1[k], and increment k.

Decrement the count in the hash map.

Return first k elements of nums1.

For our solutions here, we use one of the arrays to store the result. 
As we find common numbers, we copy them to the first array starting from the beginning. This idea is from this solution by sankitgupta.

```java
public int[] intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
    if (nums1.length > nums2.length) {
        return intersect(nums2, nums1);
    }
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
    for (int n : nums1) {
        m.put(n, m.getOrDefault(n, 0) + 1);
    }
    int k = 0;
    for (int n : nums2) {
        int cnt = m.getOrDefault(n, 0);
        if (cnt > 0) {
            nums1[k++] = n;
            m.put(n, cnt - 1);
        }
    }
    return Arrays.copyOfRange(nums1, 0, k);
}
```
