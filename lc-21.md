# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4

## Approach 1: Recursion
Intuition

We can recursively define the result of a merge operation on two lists as the following (avoiding the corner case logic surrounding empty lists):

\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} list1[0] + merge(list1[1:], list2) & list1[0] < list2[0] \\ list2[0] + merge(list1, list2[1:]) & otherwise \end{array} \right.{ 
list1[0]+merge(list1[1:],list2)
list2[0]+merge(list1,list2[1:])
​	
  
list1[0]<list2[0]
otherwise
​	
 

Namely, the smaller of the two lists' heads plus the result of a merge on the rest of the elements.

Algorithm

We model the above recurrence directly, first accounting for edge cases. Specifically, if either of l1 or l2 is initially null, 
there is no merge to perform, so we simply return the non-null list. Otherwise, we determine which of l1 and l2 has a smaller head,
and recursively set the next value for that head to the next merge result. Given that both lists are null-terminated, 
the recursion will eventually terminate.

```java

class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        if (l1 == null) {
            return l2;
        }
        else if (l2 == null) {
            return l1;
        }
        else if (l1.val < l2.val) {
            l1.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
            return l1;
        }
        else {
            l2.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);
            return l2;
        }

    }
}
```
