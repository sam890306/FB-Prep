# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory
buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization 
algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized
to the original tree structure.
Example: 
You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, 
so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

## Approach 1: Depth First Search (DFS)
Intuition

The serialization of a Binary Search Tree is essentially to encode its values and more importantly its structure.
One can traverse the tree to accomplish the above task. And it is well know that we have two general strategies to do so:
Breadth First Search (BFS)
We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height, from top to bottom. The nodes on higher level would be
visited before the ones with lower levels.
Depth First Search (DFS)
In this strategy, we adopt the depth as the priority, so that one would start from a root and reach all the way down to certain leaf,
and then back to root to reach another branch.
The DFS strategy can further be distinguished as preorder, inorder, and postorder depending on the relative order among the root node,
left node and right node.
In this task, however, the DFS strategy is more adapted for our needs, since the linkage among the adjacent nodes is naturally encoded
in the order, which is rather helpful for the later task of deserialization.
Therefore, in this solution, we demonstrate an example with the preorder DFS strategy. One can check out more tutorial about Binary 
Search Tree on the LeetCode Explore.

## Algorithm
First of all, here is the definition of the TreeNode which we would use in the following implementation.

The preorder DFS traverse follows recursively the order of
root -> left subtree -> right subtree.
As an example, let's serialize the following tree. Note that serialization contains information about the
node values as well as the information about the tree structure.

We start from the root, node 1, the serialization string is 1,. Then we jump to its left subtree with the root node 2, 
and the serialization string becomes 1,2,. Now starting from node 2, we visit its left node 3 (1,2,3,None,None,) 
and right node 4 (1,2,3,None,None,4,None,None) sequentially. Note that None,None, appears for each leaf to mark 
the absence of left and right child node, this is how we save the tree structure during the serialization. And finally,
we get back to the root node 1 and visit its right subtree which happens to be a leaf node 5. Finally, 
the serialization string is done as 1,2,3,None,None,4,None,None,5,None,None,.

Now let's deserialize the serialization string constructed above 1,2,3,None,None,4,None,None,5,None,None,. 
It goes along the string, initiate the node value and then calls itself to construct its left and right child nodes.

```java
public class Codec {
  public TreeNode rdeserialize(List<String> l) {
    // Recursive deserialization.
    if (l.get(0).equals("null")) {
      l.remove(0);
      return null;
    }

    TreeNode root = new TreeNode(Integer.valueOf(l.get(0)));
    l.remove(0);
    root.left = rdeserialize(l);
    root.right = rdeserialize(l);

    return root;
  }

  // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
  public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
    String[] data_array = data.split(",");
    List<String> data_list = new LinkedList<String>(Arrays.asList(data_array));
    return rdeserialize(data_list);
  }
};
```
