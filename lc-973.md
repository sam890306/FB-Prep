# 973. K Closest Points to Origin
https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).
(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)
You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)
 
Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
 
Note:
1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000
-10000 < points[i][0] < 10000
-10000 < points[i][1] < 10000

## pproach 1: Sort
Intuition
Sort the points by distance, then take the closest K points.
Algorithm
There are two variants.
In Java, we find the K-th distance by creating an array of 
distances and then sorting them. After, we select all the points with distance less than or equal to this K-th distance.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        int N = points.length;
        int[] dists = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            dists[i] = dist(points[i]);

        Arrays.sort(dists);
        int distK = dists[K-1];

        int[][] ans = new int[K][2];
        int t = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            if (dist(points[i]) <= distK)
                ans[t++] = points[i];
        return ans;
    }

    public int dist(int[] point) {
        return point[0] * point[0] + point[1] * point[1];
    }
}
```
