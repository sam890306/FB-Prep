Initial Thoughts
Because the tree topography is unknown ahead of time, it is not possible to design an algorithm that visits asymptotically fewer than 
nn
n nodes. Therefore, we should try to aim for a linear time solution. With that in mind, let's consider a few equally-efficient solutions.
Approach #1 Depth-First Search [Accepted]
Intuition
We can efficiently obtain the right-hand view of the binary tree if we visit each node in the proper order.
Algorithm
One of the aforementioned orderings is defined by a depth-first search in which we always visit the right subtree first. This guarantees that the first time we visit a particular depth of the tree, the node that we are visiting is the rightmost node at that depth. Therefore, we can store the value of the first node that we visit at each depth, ultimately generating a final array of values once we know exactly how many layers are in the tree.

The figure above illustrates one instance of the problem. The red nodes compose the solution from top to bottom, and the edges are labelled in order of visitation.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> rightmostValueAtDepth = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        int max_depth = -1;

        /* These two stacks are always synchronized, providing an implicit
         * association values with the same offset on each stack. */
        Stack<TreeNode> nodeStack = new Stack<TreeNode>();
        Stack<Integer> depthStack = new Stack<Integer>();
        nodeStack.push(root);
        depthStack.push(0);

        while (!nodeStack.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode node = nodeStack.pop();
            int depth = depthStack.pop();

            if (node != null) {
                max_depth = Math.max(max_depth, depth);

                /* The first node that we encounter at a particular depth contains
                * the correct value. */
                if (!rightmostValueAtDepth.containsKey(depth)) {
                    rightmostValueAtDepth.put(depth, node.val);
                }

                nodeStack.push(node.left);
                nodeStack.push(node.right);
                depthStack.push(depth+1);
                depthStack.push(depth+1);
            }
        }

        /* Construct the solution based on the values that we end up with at the
         * end. */
        List<Integer> rightView = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for (int depth = 0; depth <= max_depth; depth++) {
            rightView.add(rightmostValueAtDepth.get(depth));
        }

        return rightView;
    }
}
```
