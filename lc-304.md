# 304. Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable

https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-2d-immutable/

Given a 2D matrix matrix, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).

The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = (2, 1) and (row2, col2) = (4, 3), which contains sum = 8. 
Example:
Given matrix = [
  [3, 0, 1, 4, 2],
  [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],
  [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],
  [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]
]

sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8
sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2) -> 11
sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4) -> 12

Note:
You may assume that the matrix does not change.
There are many calls to sumRegion function.
You may assume that row1 ≤ row2 and col1 ≤ col2.

Approach #1 (Brute Force) [Time Limit Exceeded]
Algorithm
Each time sumRegion is called, we use a double for loop to sum all elements from 
(row1,col1)→(row2,col2)(row1, col1) \rightarrow (row2, col2)
(row1,col1)→(row2,col2).
```java
private int[][] data;

public NumMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
    data = matrix;
}

public int sumRegion(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int r = row1; r <= row2; r++) {
        for (int c = col1; c <= col2; c++) {
            sum += data[r][c];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```
Complexity analysis
Time complexity : 
O(mn)O(mn)
O(mn) time per query. Assume that 
mm
m and 
nn
n represents the number of rows and columns respectively, each sumRegion query can go through at most 
m×nm \times n
m×n elements.
Space complexity : 
O(1)O(1)
O(1). Note that data is a reference to matrix and is not a copy of it.

Approach #2 (Caching) [Memory Limit Exceeded]
Intuition
Since sumRegion could be called many times, we definitely need to do some pre-processing.
Algorithm
We could trade in extra space for speed by pre-calculating all possible rectangular region sum and store them in a hash table. Each sumRegion query now takes only constant time complexity.
Complexity analysis
Time complexity : 
O(1)O(1)
O(1) time per query, 
O(m2n2)O(m^2n^2)
O(m

) time pre-computation. Each sumRegion query takes 
O(1)O(1)
O(1) time as the hash table lookup's time complexity is constant. The pre-computation will take 
O(m2n2)O(m^2n^2)
O(m

) time as there are a total of 
m2×n2m^2 \times n^2
m

possibilities need to be cached.
Space complexity : 
O(m2n2)O(m^2n^2)
O(m
2
n
2
). Since there are 
mnmn
mn different possibilities for both top left and bottom right points of the rectangular region, the extra space required is 
O(m2n2)O(m^2n^2)
O(m
2
n
2
).

Approach #3 (Caching Rows) [Accepted]
Intuition
Remember from the 1D version where we used a cumulative sum array? Could we apply that directly to solve this 2D version?
Algorithm
Try to see the 2D matrix as 
mm
m rows of 1D arrays. To find the region sum, we just accumulate the sum in the region row by row.
```java
private int[][] dp;

public NumMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
    if (matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length == 0) return;
    dp = new int[matrix.length][matrix[0].length + 1];
    for (int r = 0; r < matrix.length; r++) {
        for (int c = 0; c < matrix[0].length; c++) {
            dp[r][c + 1] = dp[r][c] + matrix[r][c];
        }
    }
}

public int sumRegion(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int row = row1; row <= row2; row++) {
        sum += dp[row][col2 + 1] - dp[row][col1];
    }
    return sum;
}
```
Complexity analysis
Time complexity : 
O(m)O(m)
O(m) time per query, 
O(mn)O(mn)
O(mn) time pre-computation. The pre-computation in the constructor takes 
O(mn)O(mn)
O(mn) time. The sumRegion query takes 
O(m)O(m)
O(m) time.
Space complexity : 
O(mn)O(mn)
O(mn). The algorithm uses 
O(mn)O(mn)
O(mn) space to store the cumulative sum of all rows.
