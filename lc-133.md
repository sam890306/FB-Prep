Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. 
Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

 

Example:



Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3",
"neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
 

Note:

The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have no


Approach 1: Depth First Search
Intuition

Note: As we can see this question has garnered a lot of negative reviews. It has a lot more dislikes than the likes. 
We have tried to improve the problem statement to make it more understandable. 
However, these are the kinds of situations you might get into in an interview when the problem statement might look a little absurd. 
What is important then is to ask the interviewer to clarify the problem. 
This problem statement was confusing to me as well initially and that's why I decided to write the solution hoping to clarify most of the doubts that the readers might have had.

The basic intuition for this problem is to just copy as we go. 
We need to understand that we are dealing with a graph and this means a node could have any number of neighbors. 
This is why neighbors is a list. What is also crucial to understand is that we don't want to get stuck in a cycle while we are traversing the graph. 
According to the problem statement, any given undirected edge could be represented as two directional edges. So, if there is an undirected edge between node A and node B, the graph representation for it would have a directed edge from A to B and another from B to A. After all, an undirected graph is a set of nodes that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional. How else would you say that A could be reached from B and B could be reached from A?


To avoid getting stuck in a loop we would need some way to keep track of the nodes which have already been copied. 
By doing this we don't end up traversing them again.

## Algorithm

Start traversing the graph from the given node.

We would take a hash map to store the reference of the copy of all the nodes that have already been visited and cloned. 
The key for the hash map would be the node of the original graph and corresponding value would be the corresponding cloned node of the cloned graph. 
If the node already exists in the visited we return corresponding stored reference of the cloned node.

For a given edge A - B, since A is connected to B and B is also connected to A if we don't use visited we will get stuck in a cycle.


If we don't find the node in the visited hash map, we create a copy of it and put it in the hash map. 
Note, how it's important to create a copy of the node and add to the hash map before entering recursion.

   clone_node = Node(node.val, [])
   visited[node] = clone_node
 
In the absence of such an ordering, we would be caught in the recursion because on encountering the node again in somewhere down the recursion again, 
we will be traversing it again thus getting into cycles.


Now make the recursive call for the neighbors of the node. 
Pay attention to how many recursion calls we will be making for any given node. 
For a given node the number of recursive calls would be equal to the number of its neighbors. 
Each recursive call made would return the clone of a neighbor.
We will prepare the list of these clones returned and put into neighbors of clone node which we had created earlier. 
This way we will have cloned the given node and it's neighbors.

Tip: Recursion could get a bit cumbersome to grasp, if you try to get into every call yourself and try to see what's happening. 
And why look at every call when every call does the same thing with different inputs. 
So, you just worry about ONE such call and let the recursion do the rest. 
And of course always handle the base case or the termination condition of the recursion. Otherwise how would it end?

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    private HashMap <Node, Node> visited = new HashMap <> ();
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return node;
        }

        // If the node was already visited before.
        // Return the clone from the visited dictionary.
        if (visited.containsKey(node)) {
            return visited.get(node);
        }

        // Create a clone for the given node.
        // Note that we don't have cloned neighbors as of now, hence [].
        Node cloneNode = new Node(node.val, new ArrayList());
        // The key is original node and value being the clone node.
        visited.put(node, cloneNode);

        // Iterate through the neighbors to generate their clones
        // and prepare a list of cloned neighbors to be added to the cloned node.
        for (Node neighbor: node.neighbors) {
            cloneNode.neighbors.add(cloneGraph(neighbor));
        }
        return cloneNode;
    }
}
```
