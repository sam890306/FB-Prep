# 523. Continuous Subarray Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/

Given a list of non-negative numbers and a target integer k, write a function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2 that sums up to a multiple of k, that is, sums up to n*k where n is also an integer.
 
Example 1:
Input: [23, 2, 4, 6, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.
Example 2:
Input: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 and sums up to 42.
 
Note:
The length of the array won't exceed 10,000.
You may assume the sum of all the numbers is in the range of a signed 32-bit integer.\

Approach #2 Better Brute Force [Accepted]
Algorithm
We can optimize the brute force approach to some extent, if we make use of an array 
sumsum
sum that stores the cumulative sum of the elements of the array, such that 
sum[i]sum[i]
sum[i] stores the sum of the elements upto the 
ithi^{th}
i
th
element of the array.
Thus, now as before, we consider every possible subarray for checking its sum. But, instead of iterating over a new subarray everytime to determine its sum, we make use of the cumulative sum array. Thus, to determine the sum of elements from the 
ithi^{th}
i
th
index to the 
jthj^{th}
j
th
index, including both the corners, we can use: 
sum[j]−sum[i]+nums[i]sum[j] - sum[i] + nums[i]
sum[j]−sum[i]+nums[i].

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] sum = new int[nums.length];
        sum[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++)
            sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i];
        for (int start = 0; start < nums.length - 1; start++) {
            for (int end = start + 1; end < nums.length; end++) {
                int summ = sum[end] - sum[start] + nums[start];
                if (summ == k || (k != 0 && summ % k == 0))
                    return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis** 
Time complexity : 
O(n2)O(n^2)
O(n
2
). Two for loops are used for considering every subarray possible.
Space complexity : 
O(n)O(n)
O(n). 
sumsum
sum array of size 
nn
n is used.
