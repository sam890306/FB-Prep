# 896. Monotonic Array

An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.
An array A is monotone increasing if for all i <= j, A[i] <= A[j].  An array A is monotone decreasing if for all i <= j, A[i] >= A[j].
Return true if and only if the given array A is monotonic.
 

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,2,3]
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: [6,5,4,4]
Output: true
Example 3:
Input: [1,3,2]
Output: false
Example 4:
Input: [1,2,4,5]
Output: true
Example 5:
Input: [1,1,1]
Output: true
 
Note:
1 <= A.length <= 50000
-100000 <= A[i] <= 100000

## Approach 2: One Pass
Intuition
To perform this check in one pass, we want to handle a stream of comparisons from 
{−1,0,1}\{-1, 0, 1\}
{−1,0,1}, corresponding to <, ==, or >. For example, with the array [1, 2, 2, 3, 0], we will see the stream (-1, 0, -1, 1).
Algorithm
Keep track of store, equal to the first non-zero comparison seen (if it exists.) If we see the opposite comparison, the answer is False.
Otherwise, every comparison was (necessarily) in the set 
{−1,0}\{-1, 0\}
{−1,0}, or every comparison was in the set 
{0,1}\{0, 1\}
{0,1}, and therefore the array is monotonic.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isMonotonic(int[] A) {
        int store = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length - 1; ++i) {
            int c = Integer.compare(A[i], A[i+1]);
            if (c != 0) {
                if (c != store && store != 0)
                    return false;
                store = c;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
